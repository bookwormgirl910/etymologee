# TODO

## Fixes
- More comprehensive parsing of language origins and word stages
- Fix activation of bars
- Prevent overflow of word spans
- Allow versions of languages (e.g. Medieval Latin as well as Latin)
- Use first entry instead of entry with longest etymology or oldest date
- Fix pairing of language and word stage
- Show globe on homepage
- Make timeline more visible
- Add fallbacks (WebGL on iOS?)

## Features
- Automatic animation moving through the etymological stages
- Connecting lines between points on the globe
- Suggestions of words with interesting etymologies
- Context about historical events that enabled the words to travel and evolve
- Record (clearable) of searched words to see them in context on the timeline

## UI
- Vertical word evolution to indicate that the date refers to the latest stage of the etymology
- Place word entry close to the etymological evolution to better connect it to the final English word
