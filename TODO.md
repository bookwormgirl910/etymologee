- Fix pairing of language and word stage

## Features
- Automatic animation moving through the etymological stages

- Suggestions of words with interesting etymologies
- Context about historical events that enabled the words to travel and evolve
- Record (clearable) of searched words to see them in context on the timeline

## UI
- Vertical word evolution to indicate that the date refers to the latest stage of the etymology

- Styling
